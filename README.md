# Python OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API Example

This project serves as a basic example of using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API. It includes a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating how to interact with the API and providing a foundation for integrating OpenAI's language model into your projects.

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key (replace `<enter your api key>` in the code with your actual API key)
- Python installed
- OpenAI Python library installed (`pip install openai`)
- Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install notebook`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Esforper/OpenAI-API-Example.git
    cd OpenAI-API-Example
    ```

2. Replace `<enter your api key>` in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python api_example.py
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook api_example.ipynb
    ```

5. Follow the prompts in the notebook and explore the basic API interactions.

## Configuration

Make sure to have a valid OpenAI API key to use this script.
